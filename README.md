## Personal Webpage / Portfolio

Side note: This is a work in progress and I hope to give it a makeover soon, along with added functionality that will make it easier for the user to navigate.

I'm starting out with a single page with scroll functionality with HTML and CSS. A second page prompts the user after they enter their information via a contact form. On the back end, I use Express to spin up a web server, handle basic routing, and connect to Twilio's API. When a user submits their contact information, the API is activated and automatically sends me a text message in real time with the user's info. Finally, a .env file is used to securely store API keys and personal information from deployment to Heroku.
