## Personal Webpage / Portfolio

Important note: This is a work in progress and will be given a makeover soon, along with added functionality that will make it easier to navigate for the user. 

I'm starting out with a single page webpage with scroll functionality and a seperate page that prompts after a user enters their information via a contact form. When a user submits their contact information, Twilio's API kicks in and automatically alerts me with the user's info via a text message in real time. Finally, a .env file is used to securely store API keys and personal information from deployment.
