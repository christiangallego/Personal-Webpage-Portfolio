## Personal Webpage / Portfolio

Side note: This is a work in progress and I hope to give it a makeover soon, along with added functionality that will make it easier to navigate for the user. 

I'm starting out with a single page with scroll functionality. A second page prompts after a user enters their information via a contact form. On the back end, I use Express to spin up a web server, handle basic routing, and connect to Twilio's API. When a user submits their contact information, the API is activated and automatically alerts me with the user's info via a text message in real time. Finally, a .env file is used to securely store API keys and personal information from deployment to Heroku.
